# AtmApplication

Hello Thanks for being here!

Here how i made a simple ATM application using pure java this is how:

In the ATM application I provided earlier, the username and PIN (password) are hardcoded for simplicity. Here are the values:

Username: "12345"
PIN (Password): "6789"
These values are set as defaults in the application for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, user authentication would involve a more secure and dynamic mechanism, such as checking against a database or user management system.

Feel free to use these values for testing the application, but keep in mind that for a production application, you would need a secure authentication system and not store sensitive information like PINs in plain text.

for some reasons the transfer button may not be work because it needs a database and some functionalities which i am not able to do in this short period.
